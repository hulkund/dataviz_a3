			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p> Question to answer: How did the age density change between 1990 and 2000 between different age
				demographic groups?</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/Fig1.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					This proposed figure shows the 1900 and 2000 census data as population pyramids, with male on the
					left axis and female on the right axis.
					The x-axis has the population size and the y-axis separates the ages into bins to display the data
					like a dual-axis histogram.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The 1900 and 2000 figures are placed side by side, so comparison can be done between them to see how
					the overall shapes of the population pyramid shape has changed between the years. </li>
				<li>One strength is that it is the expected way a user reads a population pyramid (for example,
					ecological textbooks use this format of the male/female split), so the reader will more quickly
					understand the figure.</li>
				<li>However, its primary weakness is that because the two years of comparison are side by side, there is
					no shared axis to compare the two years and the reader must switch between them to understand the
					plot. Perhaps displaying on the same plot might be helpful for the next plot.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/Fig2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The proposed figure shows the 1900 and 2000 census data as population pyramids overlaid with each
					other, with male on the left axis and female on the right axis.
					The x-axis has the population size and the y-axis separates the ages into bins to display the data
					like a dual-axis histogram.
					Each solidly colored bars represent the 2000 data, while the unfilled bars represent the 1900 data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The rationale behind this graph was to show both population pyramids in one graph, with the bars
					interspersing with each other. </li>
				<li>This way, the shapes of the pyramids (representing the age density per bin) can be directly
					compared.</li>
				<li>However, there is a significant weakness in that the axis of both pyramids is inherently different.
					As such, it is difficult to see the 1900 data as well when there is much less data than the 2000
					census.
					In particular, for the age bins with the smallest populations (70+), the 1900 data will not appear.
					While this shows how life expectancy has overall increases between 1900 and 2000, leading to more
					people living longer, it does not answer the question we are asking: "the age density" as clearly.
					Perhaps annotations would help in the next iteration.</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/Fig3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The proposed figure shows the 1900 and 2000 census data as population pyramids, with the 1900 data
					on the left side and the 2000 data on the right side.
					The x-axis has the population size and the y-axis separates the ages into bins to display the data
					like a dual-axis histogram.
					The colors represent the male and female population splits in the 1900 and 2000 data. The annotated
					percent markings show how much percent of the data is from the age bracket.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The rationale behind this plot is to display both the 1900 and 2000 data in one plot, clearly
					showing how the "age density" of bins have changed over time.</li>
				<li>Here, gender is also displayed but not in the conventional male/female across axes way. This was
					because the gender split isnt the main focus of the graph, but age density.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				Overall, while the three sketches are similar in their methods of displaying data (bar/population
				pyramid styles), they show this data in different ways.
				Plot 1 displays the data in a side by side manner, allowing the reader to see both population pyramids
				and compare the age density between them, but they must switch between two plots, which makes comparison
				a bit more difficult.
				Plot 2 displays the data in one plot, but intersperses the bars. While this allows for direct
				comparison, it mainly compares the quantity of people in age bin, rather than the density (or relative
				percent of each bin). This means that this plot is good at conveying trends like "there are more 90 year
				olds in 2000 than in 1900", but does not answer the questions of what percent of the population they
				comprise.
				Plot 3 also displays the data in one plot, but changes the traditional population pyramid structure of
				male/female on left/right axes (as is shown in ecological textbooks and such), for displaying the
				1900/2000 data on the left/right axes. To me, this makes more sense, because it is what is being
				directly compared, and the shapes of the pyramid and annotations of relative percentages directly answer
				the question of age density.
				I think that Plot 3 is better than the other two for this reason: because it directly answers the
				questions we are asking. In particular, it has different x-axis scales for the 1990 and 2000 data. While
				I could have chosen to make them have the same axis, this would have shown trends similar to Plot 2
				(overall increase in buckets), rather than density of bins.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/Final-Fig.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					In this plot, we show a comparison of the census data between 1990 and 2000. The y-axis is the
					different age bins, split by every 5 years. The bottom x-axis shows the population size in millions
					and the upper x-axis shows the relative percent of each of the age bins of the total population from
					that census year. The colors in each bar represent the split of female/male within each age bracket.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				I am trying to communicate the answer to the question "How does age density of different demographic
				groups change between 1900 and 2000?" When thinking about these types of questions in the past, it
				evokes the idea of "demographic transition", or when countries develop, their population demographic
				splits often changes as fertility and mortality rates change. For example, a "expansive" population
				pyramid represents a country with higher birth rates and low death rates, generally associated with
				countries with poor medical care the very young/elderly and little birth control measures.
				<br>
				Traditional population pyramids show the male/female split on the left right/axis. Most of the
				time, when pyramids are compared, they are done side by side, emphasizing the difference in population
				split between sexes. However, for my question, I was not focusing on the sex split of the country, as
				traditionally is done. Since I was primarily concerned with comparing the age densities, I chose to not
				split the axes by sex, but by year instead, and maintain the sexes split in the color split of the bars.
				<br>
				Additionally, I decided to allow the two different time periods have different x-axes and not
				standardize them. This was because I was more concerned over the shape of pyramid (the relative
				percentages of each bin), rather than the total amount of people in each bin. I also decided to split
				the buckets into bins of size 5, rather than 10 (as I did in the drawings) because they showed a more
				clear demographic transition and breakdown of the population than the 10 year bins.
				<br>
				Furthermore, I decided to add annotations of the percent of the total for each bracket. I considered
				also adding annotations for the sex splits (51%/49% for each bar), but I thought that would confuse the
				reader with the excessive annotations. With the limited annotations, readers can directly see that, for
				example, in 2000, the peak demographic in terms of size is 35-45, whereas in 2000, it was 0-5. These
				decisions show that in 1900, the country was in the early stages of demographic transition, with high
				percent of people in the younger ages and very few elderly.
			</p>


			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				Phase 1 helped my final design in that I had a overall sense of how I wanted the plot to look (a
				population pyramid style graph), but there were different ways of displaying information in that style.
				I decided to disgard the idea of synching the axes, because it did not represent age density well
				enough. After plot 2, I decided to add annotations of the relative percent to better reflect this
				question. Contrary to the plots, I decided to increase the number of bins. Overall, plotting the
				visualizations on paper first allowed me to improve my visualizations, which I believe increased in quality with each iteration.
